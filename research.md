My research interests mainly lie in string theory and its related problems. Here is my [publications](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1260061?ui-citation-summary=true). 




## PhD time
In my PhD's study, I focused on studying F-theory compactifications (Here is my [thesis](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/26888/)) under the supervision of Prof. [Timo Weigand](https://www.qu.uni-hamburg.de/cluster/team/weigand.html).


## Postdoc period
Upon till now, I mainly work in these three directions:

- Consistency conditions in quantum gravity 
- Theormodynamics of string theory 
- Category symmetry and topological order phases
