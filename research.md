My research interests mainly lie in string theory and its related problems. 




## PhD time
In my PhD's study, I focused on studying F-theory compactifications (Here is my [thesis](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/26888/)).


## Recent interests

 - Consistency conditions in quantum gravity 
 - Category symmetry
 - Tensionless string and Theormodynamics of String theory
