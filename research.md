My research interests mainly lie in string theory and its related problems. Here is my [publications](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1260061?ui-citation-summary=true). 




## PhD time
In my PhD's study, I focused on studying F-theory compactifications (Here is my [thesis](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/26888/)).


## Postdoc period
Upon till now, I mainly work in these three directions:

- Consistency conditions in quantum gravity 
 - Category symmetry in 2D CFTs
 - Theormodynamics of string theory
